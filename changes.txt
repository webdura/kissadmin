Hi Vinayak,

Excellent progress :)
Modules and permissions is good, thanks.

Some small bugs and tweaks I have found.
Some are very minor but they need to be done so I note them as I see then in order to save time with later testing.

Thanks for the new simple theme sample - not great although it is an improvement to current theme which is not good.
You can apply it to gnet admin if you wish but gnet admin layout should remain same (eg. full page width etc.)


Bugs & tweaks:
today cannot login as admin / admin
Log in as admin then login as company then when clicking on client login get error page see screenshot.

etc

Need to allocate payments to invoices for manual and bulk payments
Show list of 'unpaid' invoices for selected client with checkboxes so that payment can be related to one or multiple invoices

automatic show invoice list after selecting client with manual payment
